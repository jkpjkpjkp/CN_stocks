## 1min p 1min
> ./min/models/quantile_quantized/t1p1.py
we discretized 1-min returns evenly into 128 bins and use a half-day context to predict next-1-min return.
works tremendously well and can achieve 10^5 top-tenth gain if we can at no cost trade per-minute.
the model is exactly the same as a dense LLM

the model achieves 2.0 val loss (cross entropy).
the same model can only achieve a 3.5 train loss. (unsaturated) -> bigger model
               diverged after 190k steps -> StableAdamW


## 1min p 30min
> ./min/models/quantile_quantized/t1p30.py
enlarged model following Ettin (2507.11412v1), which itself follows ModernBert

very weirdly, enlarging model do not drop loss below 3.5
investigating logits to see why



## compression
is absolutely the way to go

the only left algorithmic task is to discover inter-id relations


## trunk
transformer and mamba-like layers
